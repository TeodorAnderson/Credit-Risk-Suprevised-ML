# Credit-Risk-Suprevised-ML
## Teodor Anderson

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models in predicting credit risk using different resampling techniques and ensemble classifiers. In particular, we use the LendingClub credit card credit dataset and employ oversampling techniques such as RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, undersampling using ClusterCentroids, and a combination of over- and undersampling using SMOTEENN. We also use two ensemble classifiers, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to reduce bias and improve the accuracy of our predictions.
